## How does it work?

RetroSearch is a Spring Web Application that presents very simple HTML pages which can be interpreted by old browsers.
It provides the ability to search the Web using DuckDuckGo with a custom scraper that loads the first page of results and allows you to browse pages in plain text.
You can deploy it on your local network and access it from your old computer!

### WIP
Currently in progress:
 - Improve the parsing abilities for the browsing functionality
 - Add documentation and automated tests
