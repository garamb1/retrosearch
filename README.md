# RetroSearch
### Spring-based Web Search App for old computers

Search and Browse the WWW like it's 1997.

![RetroSearch on Netscape 2.0 and IE 5](https://github.com/garamb1/retrosearch/assets/3776646/4367e79a-29b4-4973-9b8c-079e2edd7ffe)

## How does it work?

RetroSearch is a Spring Web Application that presents very simple HTML pages which can be interpreted by old browsers.
It currently provides the ability to search the Web using DuckDuckGo with a custom scraper that loads the first page of results.

You can deploy it on your local network and access it from your old computer!

### WIP
Currently in progress:
 - Have the ability to open a search result using RetroSearch, which should filter and present the content in simple HTML.
 - Add documentation and automated tests
 - Deploy as public service
